     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:
     one-electron contribution =     -98.49302022 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      82.63547748 Ry
     xc contribution           =     -77.64468790 Ry
     ewald contribution        =    -230.09154669 Ry
     one-center paw contrib.   =   -1161.92338783 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  35 iterations
